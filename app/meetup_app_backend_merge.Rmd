# The Merge

Because there is not a common unique identifier between these datasets, I merged them on a partial match using company name. There were three data cleaning steps:

1. Make company names lowercase
2. Strip white space
3. Remove punctuation

```
cfpb$Company <- cfpb$Company %>% 
    tolower() %>% 
    stripWhitespace() %>% 
    removePunctuation()
```

### Affiliates and Other Irregularities

The company name on the financial statement

```
# Specify states and other endings to remove from the end of company names #
state <- tolower(unique(cfpb$State))
legal_entity <- c("inc", "corp", "co", "plc", "ltd", "llc", 
                  "company", "companymn", "holdings", "financial services", "services", 
                  "financial", "corporation", "group", "bank", "banks")
endings <- c(state, legal_entity)
```
