# CFPB's API

The Consumer Financial Potection Bureau (CFBP) has a very simple API that enables you to pull all of their complaints with the following API:

```
# Download Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Data #
if(!file.exists("cfpb.csv")){
download.file("http://data.consumerfinance.gov/api/views/s6ew-h6mp/rows.csv", "cfpb.csv")
} 
cfpb <- fread("cfpb.csv")
```

For more information on the options available, visit [CFPB Open Tech](http://cfpb.github.io/api/hmda/index.html).
